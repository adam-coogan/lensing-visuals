# Multiple imaging

Author: Adam Coogan

Shows how subhalos lead to a mismatch when reconstructing the source using the
smooth lens model.

- `obs.gif`: observation, with 5e10 solar mass subhalo indicated by the red dot.
- `lower-right.gif`, `upper-left.gif`: source reconstructions obtained by
  tracing only the lower right or upper left part of the observation back to the
  source plane.
- `combined.gif`: overlay of the ray-traced reconstructions from the lower right
  and upper left images.
- `nosh-*.png`: same thing, but with no subhalo. In this case the multiple
  images line up perfectly.
